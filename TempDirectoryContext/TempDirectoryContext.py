TemporaryDirectoryContext : Implementation of TemporaryDirectoryContext

Summary :
    A context handler wrap around the tempfile module - to enable clean up and close down
    
Use Case :
    As an application I want to be able to create and tear down temporary files so that
    I can keep the environment clean

Testable Statements :
    Can I create a temp file area
    Can I clean up the temp file area on close down or exception
    Can the context manager clean up historic directories left by previous invocations
    Can the context manager delay clean-up to allow for debugging
    Can multiple context manager be used by the same application without clashing.


Example :
    from TempDirectoryContext import TempDirectoryContext

    with TempDirectoryContext() as tmp_path:
        # A directory is created as /tmp/tmp******TempDirCont - where ****** is a random 6 character string
        # The directory is created with full read/write access for the current user
        # Your code can now work with temp files under tmp_path

    # More code outside the Context block
    # Under default behaviour the temporary directory is queued for deletion - in theory files can still be used
